        <h1>Project Expectations</h1>
        <p>We started this project with a united team, and we have finished it in the same way we
            started it. This subject has always been said to put you to the test, but it also makes the
            talent of each one shine, as well as giving rise to work on what you want to dedicate yourself
            to in the not so distant future. So, with the nerves and excitement to get into this project, we
            didn't want to wait any longer with our arms folded and, months before officially starting the
            project, we already started the preparations for everything that was coming our way.
            However, we must also highlight that some classmates had a good relationship with people
            from higher grades, who gave us a transfer of how their projects had gone and what were
            the critical points that we had to be careful of. All this prepared us all much more, in order to
            prevent possible future problems and how to manage time.
            However, since the first year of university, we have been a close-knit class where everyone
            gets along with the rest. So, one of the first preparations, which we wanted to anticipate and
            which was not difficult to manage, was the choice of leads and the producer, along with a
            first selection of which department each of us wanted to be in.
            As we have mentioned, we can say that we have been a very lucky team to have such a
            good relationship with each other, both at the beginning and throughout the project. A project
            that we hoped we would be proud to call ours as well as that it would be one of the most
            worked, outstanding and excellent at the university.
            From the very beginning, from the first class, we started off on the right foot when the
            teachers heard what the game assignment was going to be as well as the theme. This year,
            we were asked to create a Diablo-style third-person game themed around the Alien movie
            saga. Without a doubt, we accepted the challenge with enthusiasm and motivation. When
            we found out about the video game we had to create, we didn't waste a second in getting
            down to work to create our video game that not only we wanted to be proud of, but also the
            university and the industry itself</p>

            <br>
            

        <h1>Beginning</h1>
        <p>As we mentioned, from the beginning, we didn't want to waste a second, since we knew that
            we had little time and all the departments started the production of the video game, starting
            with concept discovery.
            The production team, both leads and the producer, were very clear about their role in the
            project, as well as their importance in developing the game. This began with the scheduling
            and general organization of the project with all the milestones that we had to meet according
            to a pre-established schedule. As well as the creation of a general guide for the proper
            development, operation and communication of the team. The aim was to speed up the whole
            issue of organization as much as possible, as well as to be clear about the tasks that each
            member of the team had to carry out and how to relate to each other. From the beginning,
            the team established three keywords for the project to be developed in the best way.
            Communication, empathy and motivation.
            As for the art team, they had the mission to explore and discover what artistic direction we
            would follow for the project. To do this, on the one hand, each one had to identify which were
            their weak and strong. With these and an initial research on what the setting of the Alien
            saga and the Diablo games themselves is like, they had to create various assets with
            different styles that they felt comfortable, whether it was UI, modeling, concept arts. . .
            Finally, with the different proposals, as well as with an analysis of each of the styles of its
            pros and cons, the whole team with the contributions of the art team, decided to follow a
            comic-style artistic direction for the game. Once the style was decided, it was established
            what would be the pipeline and programs/tools to follow and use with which the art team
            should work. Which concluded with the creation of an Art Bible.
            The code team had one of the most difficult tasks at the beginning of the project, which was
            the choice of which engine, of those we developed in the previous semester, to use to carry
            out our game. However, the remaining modules that were missing from the engine had to be
            implemented in order for it to be complete. These tasks were given maximum priority, but,
            even so, due to various difficulties and complexities involved in creating their own engine,
            they were delayed a little longer than expected. On the other hand, the code team was also
            dedicated to understanding and analyzing the operation of the engine, as well as the
            creation of a Technical Design Document (TDD) with which the team would be guided by the
            great programming task that had to be done and prevent future problems, both in terms of
            performance and fluidity to complete the different tasks.
            Lately, the design team had the other most important task at the beginning of the project,
            which was the drafting of the most complete and detailed form of the Game Design
            Document. To do this, they initially dedicated themselves to a stage of research and
            inspiration for various Diablo-style games, as well as the visual narrative elements that make
            the Alien film saga unique. Subsequently, all the ideas that had emerged from the design
            department were shared, as well as other contributions made by the rest of the team. From
            this, a GDD was extracted that contemplated two formulas. On the one hand, a very
            ambitious game that we wanted to develop and, on the other, everything that we believe is
            essential and necessary to make our identity game, as well as if problems arise in the future,
            to know that we should not rule out under any circumstances</p>

            <br>
            

        <h1>Middle</h1>
        <p>As the weeks went by, we saw how the project developed as well as people took time away
            from other subjects to carry out the tasks. At first, we had a rather slow start due to the
            different complications of the engine, as not all were working as we expected, including
            scripting and physics. Because of this, in the first milestones where we intended to have a
            basic test scene of what the game's gameplay would be, we could not achieve it with full
            conditions. In the subsequent deliveries, we made a boost in terms of progress in the tasks
            to be developed, until the moment when we found a bottleneck. In this case, there were
            several factors that led us to this situation. On the one hand, we had a big problem of
            memory leaks that prevented us from having a functional game loop as well as problems in
            other implementations that affected the gameplay of the game such as animations or the
            enemies themselves. With all these problems derived from using our own engine to develop
            ours, it produced a lot of frustration among colleagues that ended up resulting in Alpha1 not
            meeting the minimum requirements to have.
            At this point, the production team carried out a deep and exhaustive analysis of the situation,
            in order to redirect it in the best way and as soon as possible. Of the measures we adopted,
            one of them was to sit down and talk individually with some colleagues to analyze in detail
            and, in a more personalized way, problems they had had and look for solutions. In addition,
            the whole team as a whole made a retrospective analysis of how we had gotten here. Where
            other problems were the low communication between teammates on some occasions, one of
            the factors that we already knew was going to be a challenge from the beginning, since we
            had never worked together with so many people. However, we incorporated the daily’s so
            that everyone could convey what they were working on each day.
            After this obstacle, the project gained momentum again, with the solution of the various
            memory leaks, as well as ending the entire engine stage and from that moment on, code
            could focus much more on what would be the gameplay part.
            On the art side, they continued at a good pace where the problems that arose were, among
            them, the precaution of keeping an eye on the number of polygons that the various assets
            had, due to the limitations that the engine itself entailed, or the animations, which due to the
            implementation of the animation module in the engine was one of the most complicated,
            Some animations had to be tweaked to work well in the game. On the other hand, one of the
            other challenges that the art department had was that all the textures followed the same
            level of quality and harmony, where in some cases some retexturing had to be done to fit
            together.
            Recently, the design team finalized the Game Design Document, with what we wanted the
            final product to look like. In the following weeks, his main task was to maintain fluid
            communication with the art and code departments, in order to convey what we wanted as
            well as to receive feedback and finish complementing the GDD with the necessary
            information. Other tasks he developed were the first implementation of sound and dialogue
            in the game, as well as the editing of the different scenes.
        </p>

        <br>
            

        <h1>End</h1>
        <p>Finally, we arrive in May, a month in which, due to several deliveries, the work performance
            on the project dropped. Even so, lately we were able to start seeing the light at the end of
            the tunnel. In these last installments, a list was made of everything that remained to be done
            and an assessment was made of everything that we could have in time. In some things, they
            had to fall by the wayside, such as consumables, but prioritizing others such as having
            inventory and crafting fully functional.
            In this final stage, the art department had almost all the tasks finished and they focused on
            making retouches according to the design or optimizing all the assets according to the
            limitations of the engine.
            So, we faced the stage with the last strength we had left, having learned to know how to deal
            with the frustration of not having been able to implement several things that we had planned,
            such as lights and shadows, as well as understanding that every engine has its limitations
            and more than one of its own. We also finished closing the game with several playtesting
            sessions where they received feedback on how to improve various aspects of the video
            game.
        </p>

        <br>
            

        <h1>What went well?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">The team</strong> <br><br>What has gone well with the project? First of all, what we all think about is
                the team. Not only
                have we maintained the bond we already had as a class and we have strengthened it, but
                also the involvement of everyone in the project. Where people who were underperforming,
                after talking to them saw things differently. We learned to work together, to listen to each
                other and, above all, to understand and help each other. Yes, there were a couple of tense
                moments, but we managed to resolve them and learn from them. We improved
                communication milestone after milestone and increased and strengthened the motivation of
                the team. We shared a common goal and worked together to achieve it.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Motivation and learning</strong> <br><br> Project 3 is a subject that requires a lot of effort, but also
                offers great reward and satisfaction
                where the work is done. It is a subject where many of us have been able to experiment and
                find what we would like to work on in the future in the industry. Which meant for many,
                having the desire to make an effort, learn and surpass themselves.
                Where all the departments have given the best of themselves in order to achieve the great
                milestone of having a video game created with our own engine made by ourselves.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">The organization</strong> <br><br> The last point we want to mention in this section is the organization
                of the project and the
                team.
                On the one hand, the production team has worked very well together in order to carry out
                Alien: Extraction. We have fulfilled a large part of the schedule we had planned as well as
                we have been able to straighten out the project at the appropriate times. All this has been
                thanks to the fact that we maintained a very fluid communication, with almost daily meetings
                and an understanding and empathy on the part of the four of us, with colleagues and other
                departments.
                However, the whole team, and each one individually, has learned to manage small teams as
                a scrum master and to self-manage the same tasks by themselves. Learning the time to
                dedicate to each of them.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
            
        <h1>What can be improved?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">The engine</strong> <br><br> As we have mentioned from the beginning, creating a video game with our own
                engine
                created by us, was a great challenge due to all the complications it could entail. In this case,
                due to the time we had and the size of the team, we had to leave behind and discard several
                features of the engine, especially to be able to focus on making it as stable as possible in the
                shortest possible time.
                An engine that we are pleasantly proud of, but that has limited us when it comes to making
                the game, such as all the artistic design that we had planned at the beginning.
                One of the things that have been discarded and that we would have liked to work on more
                would be post-processing, lights and the implementation of multithreading.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Knowledge</strong> <br><br> As it could not be otherwise, being a subject, many things we did not know
                how they worked
                or would work had to be learned during the project. One of them has been the fact of using
                our own engine and how to adapt it according to the needs of the project.
                On the other hand, the design department has also had to learn how to design a video game
                of these great characteristics from scratch. Among them, the whole issue of level design that
                we had not previously given.
                Related to art, the artists have had to learn to adapt their level to the rest of their classmates
                so that there is an egalitarian work. However, they have learned different techniques that
                they had not taught us before.
                Finally, the production team, the biggest challenge we have had. On the one hand has been
                to learn to manage a large team of colleagues and, on the other, to know how to combine
                what would be the work of directing with the work that would be our turn of the department</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Implication and communication</strong> <br><br> The last big challenge we faced was communication and
                involvement throughout this project
                that has lasted a total of four months.
                From the beginning, we knew that maintaining the same pace was always impossible and
                that there were going to be ups and downs. As well as communication, which always has
                been empathetic and looking beyond one's problems and work.
                In this project we have been able to put into practice what it is to work on a great project, in
                which everyone has a responsibility, contributes in one way or another and has an impact on
                others. Therefore, to learn to make the work that each one does individually, but above all
                that of the rest of our colleagues, where we are all in the same boat rowing in the same
                direction. That when sometimes the situation is stressful or can overcome us, we have to
                learn to try to handle it in the best way and rest if necessary, trying not to harm the rest of the
                team in any way.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
            
        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>After many months of work and effort, we can say that we have finished Alien: Extraction!
            It has been a very enriching project on the one hand for the whole experience of creating a
            video game with its own engine simulating what would be a professional game studio, but
            also frustrating at times.
            If we start with the bad part, as we have mentioned throughout the postmortem, the heaviest
            part has been all the problems that the engine has given us. We would have liked to have
            had more time to work on it, as well as other previous knowledge. However, we believe that
            it has also been very useful for us to learn how a motor works properly as well as all the
            problems it can entail. Also that of having to learn to decide that it is essential and that it can
            be discarded. But, we will always be left with the doubt of how the game would have turned
            out with some of these things solved as if we had done it with a commercial engine like Unity
            or Unreal.
            On the other hand, there is the great effort that each of us has had to dedicate to achieve
            this great challenge. A large amount of hours, work and dedication that caused us to be
            more lame in other subjects. That is why we believe that the balance of hours between
            Project 3 and the other subjects is not balanced, since this has also been one of the factors
            that has caused a great exhaustion in several classmates in order to achieve all the work of
            the semester together with the development of the video game itself.
            Lately, if we focus on the positive points, we have already commented on many of them. The
            most important thing of all we believe has beenhow enriching the experience has been for
            each of us to discover and find what we feel comfortable with. However, so that he could
            demonstrate all his talent in the project, putting into practice everything each onehas learned
            as other new things. A project that we consider to be our first step towards what we want to
            dedicate ourselves to in the future.
            It is also worth highlighting all the work and learning we have done towards communication
            and team organization that we have done: an essential task that until now we had not clearly
            had the opportunity to put into practice and improve.
            And above all, how we have learned to overcome the various difficulties that have appeared
            throughout the project. In how we have learned to understand each other and give the
            maximum of each of us for a common good above the grade that the project may have. We started out as a tam
            long before and we ended up being a team, proud of our video game Alien: Extraction.</p>
